# Welcome to Hanabi

Hanabi is a multiplayer game with a client-server architecture. The project consists of two main components: the server (backend) and the client (frontend). The server handles the game logic, and the client is used to interact with the game.

## Getting Started

To run the **Hanabi** app, you'll need to start both the **server** and **client** components.

### Requirements

- **Java 17+** for the server
- **Kotlin** for the client
- **Gradle** for building and running both server and client

### Running the Server

The server is built with **Spring Boot**. It handles the game logic and API endpoints. You can find more information on how to run the server in the `server/README.md` file.

### Running the Client

The client is a **Kotlin** application. It interacts with the server by calling the game endpoints. You can find more information on how to run the client in the `client/README.md` file.
